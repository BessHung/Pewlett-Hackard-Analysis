# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Pwelett Hackard company is preparing for upcoming employee retirements in next few years. At first, we are using a set of 6 csv files to build an employee database with SQL and find out there are 90,398 employees eligible for the retirement package with a quick query. 

To a take deeper look on those eligible- employee, we will generate two reports below to help managers in each department to make a plan on “silver tsunami”.
-	The number of retiring employees per title: Count the number of employees by most recent title who were born between 1952-01-01 and 1955-12-31.
-	The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program: Create a Mentorship Eligibility table for current employees who were born in 1965.
